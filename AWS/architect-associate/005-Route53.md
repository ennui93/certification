Route53
=================

DNS 101
-----------
* Convert human readable www.blah.com into an IP address
    * Think telephone book, convert human name to his telephone
* IPv4 vs IPv6
* Top Level Domain
    * .com, .eu, .gov
    * See Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for details
* Domain Registrars
    * GoDaddy etc
    * Enforces uniqueness of domain names in WhoIs database
* Start of Authority (SOA) records
    * Records info about domain, e.g.
        * Administrator
        * TTL, duration of DNS record being cached by servers or local PCs
* Name Server (NS) Records
    * Used by Top Level Domain servers to direct traffic to your Name Servers
* Time To Live (TTL)
    * Duration of DNS record being cached by servers or local PCs
    * Mostly defaults to about 2 days
    * The lower the value the faster is change propagation through internet
* Canonical Names (CName)
    * Resolve one name to another, e.g. both m.acloud.guru and mobile.acloud.guru can resolve to the same IP
    * Also works for external domains
* Alias
    * Amazon specific tool
    * Not charged for requests against Aliases 
    * Similar to CName
        * e.g. Alias resource record points to ELB lb1-1234.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. If ELB IP was to change, 
        Route53 would automatically update DNS answers without any changes
