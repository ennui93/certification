VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
=================

VPC 101
-----------
* One of the most important topics
* Think of Virtual Data Center in the cloud
    * Logically isolated section of AWS resources
* Hardware VPC
    * Hybrid Cloud - AWS as extension of existing corporate data center
* VPC Peering
    * No transitive VPC Peering, i.e. if
        * VPC 1 peered to VPC 2
        * VPC 2 peered to VPC 3
        * VPC 1 cannot talk to VPC 3 without direct peering

VPC Lab
-----------
* Create VPC
    * CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Rooting
        * 10.0.0.0/16
        * 8bits.8bits.8bits.8bits = 32bits
        * 2 ^ (32 - 16) = 2 ^ 16 = 65536 addresses available with this mask
    * Tenancy
        * Dedicated
            * All resources will be on dedicated hardware, e.g. EC2
    * Route table created automatically when VPC is created
* Create Subnets
    * Always mapped to one AZ, cannot be across multiple AZ. One Subnet = One AZ
* Create Internet Gateway
    * Only one Internet Gateway per VPC
* Edit Route Table
    * Inside our VPC
    * Add route
        * Allow all traffic (0.0.0.0/32) to our Internet Gateway
    * Associate with a subnet which requires Internet access
* Launch EC2 instance
    * Public Subnet 1 with Internet
    * Can ssh into this instance
* Launch EC2 instance 
    * Private Subnet 2 without Internet
    * Single Security Group can be applied across different Subnets (AZ)
    * Cannot directly ssh into this instance from Internet or update system from Internet
    * Can ssh into this instance from another EC2 instance in Subnet 1 using private ip, e.g. `ssh ec2-user@10.0.1.0 -i key.pem`
