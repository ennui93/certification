EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud
=================

EC2
---------
* Provisioned by
    * On Demand: by the hour
    * Spot: bid price
        * Hour is paid be the one who terminates the instance (you vs amazon)
    * Reserved: long-term contract
* Families
    * General Purpose
        * T
        * M
    * Optimised
        * Compute: lowest cost per vCPU
            * C
        * Memory: lowest cost per GB RAM
            * R for memory hungry apps e.g. cache, databases, SharePoint
        * Storage 
            * I IOPS of high speed random access of SSD, for NoSQL
            * D Dense storage for large scale warehouses
        * Graphic
            * G Media processing, encoding, 3d etc
* Termination protection is OFF by default
* Roles are assigned only while being provisioned

EBS Volumes and Snapshots
-----------
* Volumes
    * Stored on EBS
    * General Purpose SSD: Up to 10k IOPS
    * Provisioned IOPS SSD: More than 10k IOPS 
    * Magnetic: cheap, infrequent
    * Cannot mount single EBS volume to multiple instances
    * Deleted by default on EC2 termination
    * Root volumes encryption requires 3rd party tools
    * Commands


    #list attached volumes
    lsblk
    #see what is on attached EBS volume
    sudo su
    file -s /dev/xvdf
    #format volume
    mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
    #create mount point
    mkdir /fileserver
    #mount attached volume
    mount /dev/xvdf /fileserver
    ls /fileserver
    #unmount
    umount /fileserver

* Snapshots
    * Stored in S3
    * Snapshots are incremental
        * First snapshot may take longer
    * Snapshot encryption follows EBS source encryption
        * Cannot share encrypted snapshots
    * Root volumes should be stopped
    * Root volumes are stopped automatically by AWS
    * Snapshots of other volumes can be taken while running
    * Can be restored to other volume types

RAID Groups
---------
* Redundant Array of Independent Disk
    * Multiple disks work as a single one
* To increase IOPS if required
* RAID 0 - Striped, No Redundancy, Good Performance
* RAID 1 - Mirrored, With Redundancy
* RAID 5 - Good for reads, bad for writes, AWS does not recommend
* RAID 10 - Striped and Mirrored, Good Redundancy, Good Performance
* Snapshot of RAID
    * Stop apps writing to disk and flush caches to disk
        * Freeze file system
        * Un-mount RAID
        * Stop EC2 instance


AMI: Amazon Machine Image
-------------------
* Image
    * Created from a snapshot
    * Stored in S3
    * Stored for specific Region
        * Can be copied between Regions
            * In Console
            * With API
            * With EC2 API
    * Public 
        * Security implications
            * shred keys/certs
            * no default settings
            * remove bash history
            * etc
    * Private
    * Shared with specific AWS accounts
* Root Device Storage Type
    * Persistent EBS
    * Ephemeral Instance Store
        * Data lost if host fails
        * Deleted on termination
        * Can be rebooted without loosing data
    
Load Balancer
------------
* Goes by DNS name, never an IP
* Cross-zone balancing
* Health status based on specific ping address
    * Can redirect to another port

Cloud Watch
-------------
* Used for performance monitoring
    * Don't confuse with CloudTrail which is for auditing 
* Types
    * Standard 5 minute intervals
        * Enabled by default
    * Detailed 1 minute intervals
* Metrics for Services, e.g.
    * EC2
    * S3
* Dashboards
    * Widget
    * Text
* Events
    * Respond to state changes in AWS resources with Lambda
        * e.g. to update DNS when new EC2 starts
        * e.g. periodically create a snapshot of EBS volume
* Logs
    * Aggregate, monitor and store logs. e.g. Apache Logs
* Alarms
    * Get notified and take action when particular threshold are hit
    * Select Metric with Threshold
    * Action
        * Notification
            * Email
        * EC2 Action
            * Stop/Reboot/Terminate etc
        * Auto-scaling action
        
        
CLI: Command Line Interface
----------------
* Can be used with 
    * User key and secret
    * EC2 IAM Role
        * More secure
        * Easier to manage
* Commands

        #configure credentials
        aws configure
        #execute aws command
        aws s3 ls
        #see local credentials
        vi ~/.aws/credentials
    
Bootstrap scripts
----------------
* Added while creating an instance
    * As text
    * As file
    
Metadata
----------------

    #latest metadata - don't forget the trailing slash!
    curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

Auto-scaling
--------------
* Create Launch Configuration
    * The same as creating EC2 instance
* Create Auto-scaling Group
    * Define rules for scaling up/down, e.g. based on CPU Utilisation
    * All instances are terminated automatically once auto-scaling group is deleted

Placement Groups
-----------------
* Advantages
    * 10 Gbps Network
    * Low latency
    * High throughput
* Disadvantages
    * Cannot span Availability Zones, i.e. single point of failure
    * Cannot move existing instance ot Placement Group, can only launch new instances into it
    * Cannot merge Placement Groups
    
EFS: Elastic File System
-------------
* No pre-provisioning required, pay for GBs in use
* Block based storage
* Read After Write Consistency
    * Can read immediately after a new write
    * Updates and deletes take time to propagate
* Thousands of concurrent connections
* Scales to petabytes
* Supports Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol
* Data stored across AZ in one region
* EC2 instance should be in the same security group as EFS
* The same mount command on all instances 
    * `sudo mount -t nfs4 $(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone).fs-[number].efs.us-west-2.amazon.com:/ /var/www/html`

Lambda
------------
* Service which runs your code (Javascript, Python, Java) in response to events
* Lambda administers the underlying compute resources
    * Servers and operating systems
    * Capacity provisioning
    * Scaling
    * Logging and monitoring
* Pricing
    * $0.20 per 1M Requests
        * 1M Free
    * $0.00001667 per 1GB-seconds Compute Duration
        * 400,000 GB-seconds Free
    * Example
        * You allocated 128MB of memory to your function, executed it 30 million times and it ran for 200ms each time
        * How much would the monthly charges be?
        * Total = Req Total + Compute Total
            * Req Total = (Req Usage 30M - Req Free Tier Allowance 1M) * $0.20 = 29M * $0.20 = $5.80
            * Compute Total = (Compute Usage 128/1024 * 0.2 * 30M - Compute Free Tier Allowance 400000) * $0.00001667 = 350000 * $0.00001667 = $5.83
            * Total = 5.8 + 5.83 = 11.63
